/**
 * This car against the FINN Lens benchmark, one card per measure.
 *
 * A card each, not rows of a table. The table this replaces was accurate and
 * horrible to look at: a column header strip reading MEASURE / THIS CAR /
 * FINN LENS BENCHMARK, hairline dividers, a 4px edge, and five sizes of type
 * per row with two coloured pills competing inside them. It read as a
 * spreadsheet with fine print, which is what a reader who doesn't know whether
 * 126 g/km is good or bad least needs.
 *
 * What carries meaning now:
 *
 * - **the figure**, at a size you can read across a room, in black;
 * - **the verdict**, as coloured words beside it rather than a second pill —
 *   the class pill is the only pill left in a card;
 * - **the bar**, thick enough to be the thing your eye lands on, filled in the
 *   row's own colour with the benchmark notched across it in blue;
 * - **blue**, used for one thing only: the benchmark, wherever it appears.
 *
 * The tone is on `data-tone` as well as in the colours, so what a card claims
 * can be checked without pinning a class name.
 *
 * Every word comes from `environment-copy` or `usage-copy`; this file only
 * lays them out. The in-page panel's twin is `comparisonTable` in
 * `lens-panel/sections.ts`.
