 * A row that explains itself: what it shows, an "i" at the far right where an

 * "i" is clicked.
 *
 * These were tooltips. A tooltip covers whatever is around it, closes when the
 * pointer drifts, and is a cramped place to read a short paragraph, which is
 * what these explanations are. Opening them under the row keeps them next to
 * the numbers they're about, and they stay open until the reader closes them.
 *
 * The "i" is always at the far right, so every explanation opens from the same
 * place. A row with nothing to explain keeps the space, so a table's columns
 * still line up. An exported file shows every row open. The in-page panel's
 * twin is `explainedRow` in `lens-panel/sections.ts`.
