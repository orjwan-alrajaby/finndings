/**
 * The priority order, as one list.
 *
 * This started life in Settings, where an answer already existed and only
 * needed adjusting, and it is now the only way the question gets asked
 * anywhere. The compare flow used to split it in two — a screen to choose
 * priorities, then a screen to order them — which asked the reader to hold
 * a decision in their head across a page turn and gave them no way to see,
 * while choosing, what the order they were building actually looked like.
 * One list answers both halves at once: what you picked is what you see,
 * in the order it counts.
 *
 * Both callers get the same list. What differs is the framing around it —
 * Settings says "your priorities", the compare flow explains what a
 * priority is first — and how the profiles are offered.
 *
 * Three pieces, and they are used in different combinations: the list
 * itself, the profiles that fill it in one go, and the sentence that
 * explains what an order is for. Every caller takes at least two of them,
 * which is why this stays one module with one entry.
