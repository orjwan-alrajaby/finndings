/**
 * Lens AI, shown working and offered once — never pressed.
 *
 * Built like the tour two screens back, on purpose: the reader has already
 * learned that a drawing of finn.com here is live and that the navy bubbles
 * walk them through it. So the same page comes back with the one thing Lens
 * AI adds — the Ask Lens bubble — and the guide opens it, shows a message
 * going in, what Lens understood, and the car it picked.
 *
 * Two halves of that conversation are different in kind, and the screen says
 * so. The reading of the message is an example of what the model returns.
 * The pick is not: it's the real engine run over the demo cars against the
 * reader's own settings (`demoConversation`), in the chat's real cards.
 *
 * Below the page, the choice. "Not now" is already selected, because Lens is
 * complete without the AI, and nothing is saved until setup finishes.
