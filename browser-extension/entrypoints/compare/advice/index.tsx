/**
 * The recommendation: one car, and the case for it.
 *
 * This used to also hold the hot seat — a picker, a gains-and-losses table,
 * and a cost section that swapped its subject to whichever car the picker was
 * pointing at. One page therefore argued for a car and then argued against it,
 * and which of the two it was currently about depended on a control halfway
 * down it. The PDF was worse: the export flattened both halves into one
 * document, so a reader sending it to somebody could not say which car it was
 * recommending. Challenging now has its own tab and its own file.
 *
 * What is left is a single subject. Every figure on this view is the winner's,
 * so nothing here changes under the reader except by their own answers.
 *
 * The order of the sections is the argument, and it follows the order a reader
 * asks the questions in:
 *
 *   1. Which car?           — the hero
 *   2. What does it cost?   — at their mileage, not the sticker
 *   3. What does it use?    — the consumption behind that cost
 *   4. Why that one?        — their priorities, in their order
 *   5. What am I giving up? — the tradeoffs
 *
 * Money and consumption come before the equipment audit because they are what
 * this page can tell a reader that a FINN listing cannot. The hero already
 * carries the verdict, so nothing is lost by making the case for it after.
 *
 * Everything is a reading of the answers held in the compare store, so a
 * change made in the drawer re-reasons the page under the reader's hands.
