/**
 * The car in the hot seat, announced the way the recommendation is.
 *
 * The challenge tab used to open on a picker, which made it read as a tool
 * rather than as a reading — and its PDF opened on a row of buttons. It is a
 * report about one car, the same as the advice tab is, so it gets the same
 * shape: a hero naming the subject, then the evidence.
 *
 * **Black, where the recommendation is navy.** The two are the same object in
 * different roles and the page has to say which is which before a word is
 * read. Navy is FINN's own accent and belongs to the answer; black is the
 * page's ink, and reads as considered rather than as endorsed — this car is
 * being *examined*, and the hero should not look like a second recommendation
 * or a rejection. Amber was the other candidate and is already spoken for: it
 * means "over budget" everywhere else on this page, which is a claim about a
 * car rather than a role.
 *
 * The verdict here is the challenge's own — why the recommendation still
 * stands, or why this is genuinely close — never the challenger's fit band on
 * its own. A band would answer "how good is this car", and the question on
 * this tab is "would swapping be better", which is a different sentence.
