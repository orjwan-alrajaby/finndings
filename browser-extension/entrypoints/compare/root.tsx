 * This was a four-step wizard — priorities, feature picks, driving
 * assumptions, and only then a recommendation. Two things were wrong with
 * that. The product already has an onboarding flow that asks those same
 * questions once, so the wizard re-asked what the reader had answered; and
 * the questions are unanswerable in the abstract anyway. Nobody knows
 * whether their order is right until they have seen what it recommends.
 *
 * So the page opens on the recommendation, built from the reader's saved
 * answers, and "something doesn't look right?" opens those answers over it in
 * a drawer. The drawer holds a draft and commits it in one act, so this page
 * re-reasons when the reader saves rather than on every keystroke inside it.
