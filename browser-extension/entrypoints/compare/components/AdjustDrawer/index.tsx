/**
 * The questions, over the answer rather than in front of it.
 *
 * These three — the priority order, what counts inside each priority, and
 * what the reader's driving costs — used to be three steps walked before any
 * recommendation existed. That asked someone to tune a thing they had never
 * seen: you cannot tell whether "practicality third" is right until you have
 * watched what third does to the result. So the advice comes first, and this
 * is where it gets argued with.
 *
 * Two things changed here, and they are the same change twice.
 *
 * **It is a drawer now, not a splint.** The page used to give up 27rem of its
 * width whenever this opened, so that a change could be watched landing
 * behind it. In practice it squeezed the advice into a column too narrow to
 * read while the reader worked in a column too narrow to work in, and neither
 * half got the room it needed. It is a proper modal drawer with a backdrop:
 * it overlays the page, it is as wide as it needs to be, and the page it
 * covers is waiting underneath.
 *
 * **Nothing lands until Save.** Every control used to write straight into the
 * store, so the recommendation re-reasoned on each keystroke — which is
 * exactly the behaviour the drawer's own width existed to justify. Once it
 * overlays the page there is nothing to watch, and re-reasoning under a
 * covered page is work nobody asked for. So the drawer holds a draft and
 * commits it in one act, through the same `SaveControl` the settings page
 * uses and saying the same three things: unsaved changes, save, saved.
 *
 * The draft outlives a close on purpose. A reader who shuts the drawer to
 * re-read the advice has not thrown their edits away, and reopening it to
 * find them gone would be the drawer deciding that for them.
