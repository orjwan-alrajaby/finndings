/**
 * Lens's answer on the card, before the reader opens anything.
 *
 * The panel answers "how does this car fit me" one car at a time, which is the
 * right shape for a car the reader is already looking at and the wrong shape
 * for a page of forty. Browsing is a scanning activity: the reader is deciding
 * which cars are worth opening, and an answer they have to open a car to get
 * arrives after the decision it was meant to inform.
 *
 * So every card FINN draws gets a Lens control, and clicking it opens the
 * panel on that car. Where a verdict can be worked out, the control carries
 * it, in the same words and the same four-segment meter the panel uses.
 *
 * **The control and the verdict arrive separately, and that is the point.**
 * This used to be one pass that did both, which meant a card got nothing at
 * all until the car's data had reached storage — and that data does not
 * arrive with the card. finn.com draws the cards; the interceptor's copy of
 * FINN's own response lands afterwards. So the control appeared on some page
 * loads and not others, for a reason the reader could neither see nor act on,
 * while the pin button beside it appeared every time. The pin button needs
 * nothing but the card it goes on. Now neither does this.
 *
 * The button therefore goes on in the same synchronous pass as the pin
 * button, saying what it can honestly say at that moment — that Lens can
 * answer this question — and the verdict replaces that as soon as there is
 * one. Clicking works throughout: the panel names the car and waits.
 *
 * Two rules survive from when this was one pass, and one does not:
 *
 * - **Nothing invented.** A car whose equipment FINN didn't list has no fit
 *   to report, so the control keeps its neutral label rather than claiming a
 *   band it can't support.
 *
 * - ~~Nothing without data.~~ Gone. It was a rule about what to *draw*, and
 *   its effect was to hide the way in to the one screen that could have
 *   filled the gap it was reacting to.
 *
 * - ~~No verdict without settings.~~ Also gone, and for a related reason.
 *   Lens ships defaults now — a priority order, and the five features most
 *   drivers say they care about in each — so it has a real opinion to give
 *   before the reader has said anything. The rule behind the rule survives
 *   intact: a verdict built from Lens's assumptions must never be passed off
 *   as the reader's own. There is no room on a pill to say that, so the
 *   panel one click away says it, at the top, before the reading. See
 *   `defaultsNotice`.
