/**
 * Answering "which car is this?" for a button that is drawn before the answer
 * exists.
 *
 * The control on a card now appears the moment the card does, alongside the
 * pin button, while the car's data arrives separately — finn.com draws the
 * cards, and the interceptor's copy of FINN's own response reaches storage
 * afterwards. So a reader can very reasonably click a car we are about to
 * know about, and "we couldn't load this car" would be a lie told
 * milliseconds before it stopped being one.
 *
 * Hence a wait, and hence its two limits: it wakes on the write rather than
 * polling for it, and it gives up rather than spinning forever.
 *
 * And hence the third step. A car FINN genuinely never sent — a card drawn
 * from markup, a cache cleared underneath us, a page fetched before the
 * interceptor was installed — is asked for outright, the way the pin button
 * has always asked for it. Not asking was the bug: the reader could pin a car
 * that Lens then claimed not to know about.
