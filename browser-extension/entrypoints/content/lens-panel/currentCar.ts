/**
 * One car by id: from what we have, then from what is arriving, then by

 *
 * Three steps because there are three genuinely different reasons the car
 * might not be in hand, and only the last of them is a dead end.
 *
 * **We already have it.** Usually true. The interceptor keeps a copy of every
 * car FINN's own pages fetch, so the car the reader clicked was very likely
 * kept when the page that drew it loaded.
 *
 * **It is on its way.** The button that leads here is drawn the moment the
 * card exists — the same moment the pin button appears — while the data
 * arrives separately, when the interceptor's copy reaches storage. A miss in
 * that window is not "we don't have this car", it is "not yet", and the gap
 * is a few hundred milliseconds. Waiting costs nothing and asks FINN nothing.
 *
 * **FINN never sent it.** Which happens: a card drawn from markup rather than
 * from a response we saw, a cache cleared underneath us, a page that fetched
 * before the interceptor was installed. This used to give up here, on the
 * reasoning that a request would be asking FINN twice for something it had
 * already sent — true of the first two cases and false of this one. The pin
 * button has always fetched in exactly this situation, using exactly this
 * helper, so a reader could pin a car that Lens then claimed not to know
 * about. Now both ask.
 *
 * The badges still never fetch. Forty cards on a listing are not forty
 * reasons to call FINN's API — the request happens when a reader asks about
 * one car, which is one request for one deliberate act.
