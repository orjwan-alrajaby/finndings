/**
 * The pinned cars, as something the reader owns rather than something that
 * happens to them.
 *
 * Pinning was one-way. The button on finn.com toggles, so a car could be
 * unpinned from the page it was pinned on — and nowhere else. Once the reader
 * had moved on, or the listing had gone, the pin was permanent: the compare
 * flow showed the set and gave no way to change it, and the popup showed
 * three of them and no way to change it either. A set you can only add to
 * stops being a comparison and becomes a pile.
 *
 * So: the whole set, with the two things missing from it — removing one, and
 * reading the analysis of one without hunting for it on finn.com. The second
 * matters more than it looks. That analysis is reachable only from a card
 * badge on finn.com, which means the reader could only ask "how does this suit
 * me?" about a car they were already looking at. Here they can ask it about
 * any car they kept, side by side with the rest.
