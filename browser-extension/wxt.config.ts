   * react-to-pdf takes its screenshot with html2canvas, which was last
   * released before CSS Color 4 and cannot parse `color-mix(in oklab, …)`.
   * Tailwind v4 compiles every opacity utility — `bg-white/45`, `ring-white/60`
   * — to exactly that, so the PDF export threw on the first colour it met
   * rather than producing a file.
   *
   * html2canvas-pro is the maintained fork of the same library, same API,
   * with the modern colour functions understood. Aliased rather than adopted
   * outright because react-to-pdf asks for `html2canvas` by name: this hands
   * it the fork without forking react-to-pdf itself.
