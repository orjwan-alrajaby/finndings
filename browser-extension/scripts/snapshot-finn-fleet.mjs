/**
 * Takes a snapshot of FINN's available cars for the engine's fleet tests.
 *
 * The scoring model's thresholds — which equipment is baseline, where the
 * length and range curves bend, whether a profile keeps its promise — are
 * calibrated against what FINN actually rents, not against invented cars. The
 * tests that hold them there must not reach the network, so they read this
 * committed copy instead, and this script is how the copy is refreshed.
 *
 * It keeps only the fields `mapFinnConfig` reads, so the snapshot exercises
 * the real mapper, and it stores each equipment list as indices into one
 * shared key table rather than repeating fifty German names per car.
 *
 * Run with: node scripts/snapshot-finn-fleet.mjs
