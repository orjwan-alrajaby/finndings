 * Taking the advice away as a file.
 *
 * A recommendation is a thing people argue about with somebody else — a
 * partner, a housemate, whoever is paying half of it — and until now the only
 * way to show it to them was to sit them in front of this browser profile.
 * The page is already the whole argument in order, so the export is a
 * photograph of it rather than a second, print-shaped rendering of the same
 * facts. Two renderings of one argument is how the two start disagreeing.
 *
 * What the file must not carry is the parts of the page that only mean
 * something while it is on screen: the buttons that change the answers, and
 * the picker that chooses which rival to examine. Those are marked
 * `finn-lens-screen-only` and dropped for the capture — see the rule in
 * assets/tailwind.css. Whichever rival was in the hot seat when the reader
 * pressed the button is kept, because that comparison is part of what they
 * are taking away; when nothing is in it, nothing is added.
 *
 * What it must carry is the links. The capture is a photograph, so every
 * anchor in it — "View this car on FINN", first among them — arrives as
 * pixels of a button that cannot be pressed. A file whose whole purpose is
 * to be sent to somebody else should not be the one copy of this argument
 * with no way back to the cars. So the anchors are measured on the page and
 * re-added to the document as link annotations, which is a thing PDF has
 * and an image does not.
