/**
 * The one-paragraph summary of a pairwise comparison.

 * Deliberately narrow. This answers "what separated these two cars on the
 * priorities?" and nothing else — the budget, the cost and the recommendation
 * itself are explained once each, elsewhere, by `narrative/verdict.ts` and
 * `narrative/challenge.ts`. Saying any of it a second time here is how the
 * page ended up making the same point four ways.
 *
 * The rule every sentence obeys: name the thing. A gap is explained by the
 * equipment or the measurement behind it, never by reciting the points it was
 * worth. The weighted arithmetic sits beside this paragraph in the
 * contribution table, where a number is what the reader came for.
