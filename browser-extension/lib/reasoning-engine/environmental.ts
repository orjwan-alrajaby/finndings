/**
 * What a car emits, how efficiently it uses what it burns, and what neither
 * figure can say on its own.
 *
 * This replaces a model that scored four things and averaged them: CO₂ g/km,
 * CO₂ class, consumption, and fuel type. Three of those four were not
 * independent of the first, and the research says so plainly.
 *
 * **The CO₂ class is the CO₂ figure.** Since the Pkw-EnVKV was amended in
 * February 2024 the German class is a pure function of WLTP combined CO₂ in
 * g/km — A at 0, B to 95, C to 115, D to 135, E to 155, F to 175, G above
 * that — and the amendment's own summary of what changed is that the reference
 * to vehicle weight was dropped. Scoring the figure and the class as two votes
 * counted one measurement twice.
 *
 * **Consumption is the CO₂ figure too, for anything that burns fuel.** The
 * Commission's real-world monitoring puts 1.2 L/100 km of petrol at 28 g
 * CO₂/km, which is the carbon in a litre of petrol and nothing else. A petrol
 * car's CO₂ per kilometre is its litres per kilometre times a constant.
 *
 * **Fuel type is not a measurement at all.** It is what tells you how to read
 * the other two — that a zero is a tailpipe zero, that a plug-in hybrid's
 * figure assumes charging — and giving it its own score marked a petrol car
 * down twice for being petrol: once in its CO₂ and again for the fuel that
 * produced it.
 *
 * So there is one score here, not four:
 *
 * - **Environmental impact** is tailpipe CO₂, placed on the EU's own class
 *   scale. The boundaries are the regulation's, not ours.
 *
 * - **Efficiency** is a separate, cohort-relative reading of consumption —
 *   "frugal for a petrol car" — because a litre and a kilowatt-hour are not
 *   comparable quantities, and because a reader who wants a petrol car is
 *   entitled to know which petrol car is the frugal one rather than being told
 *   again that petrol cars burn petrol.
 *
 * - **Powertrain** is context, and carries the caveats.
 *
 * The two answers are allowed to disagree, and that disagreement is the useful
 * part: a frugal petrol car is genuinely efficient *and* genuinely a worse
 * emitter than an electric one, and a reader deciding between petrol cars
 * needs the first while a reader deciding between powertrains needs the second.
 *
 * Sources: Pkw-EnVKV §3a and ADAC's summary of the 2024 amendment; the
 * European Commission's report on real-world CO₂ from on-board monitoring;
 * ICCT's analysis of the EEA's 2024 registration data (research brief ID 482),
 * its 2025 life-cycle report, its battery-size report, and its work on
 * plug-in hybrid utility factors.
