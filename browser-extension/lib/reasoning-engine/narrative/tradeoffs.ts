/**
 * What the reader is giving up.
 *
 * This is not a disclaimer and not a footnote. A recommendation presented
 * without its compromises is half an answer, so this reasoning is built to
 * the same standard as the reasoning that produced the recommendation: every
 * item names the thing being given up, quotes the figures behind it, names
 * the car that has it, and says why *this* reader should care.
 *
 * Two filters keep it honest:
 *
 * - **Relevance.** A compromise is only surfaced when it answers to something
 *   the user told us — a priority they ranked, a feature they picked out, or
 *   the budget they set. High CO₂ is a fact about a car; it is only a tradeoff
 *   for someone who said the environment matters. Manufacturing importance is
 *   its own dishonesty.
 *
 * - **Restraint.** Only the alternatives the recommendation is actually
 *   competing with can source a compromise, and only the most consequential
 *   few are shown. A recommendation followed by nine caveats is unusable.
