 * The Advice, as structured reasoning.
 *
 * One call produces everything the UI needs to explain a car: why it placed
 * where it did, what it gives the user for each thing they said mattered,
 * what it costs, and what they're accepting in exchange. The UI renders it —
 * it does not decide any of it.
 *
 * Works identically for the recommended car and for any car the user puts in
 * the hot seat. The only input that changes is `isRecommendation`, which
 * affects how the result is framed and never what the numbers say.
