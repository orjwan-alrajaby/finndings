 * Two rules govern this file, and both exist because the old version broke
 * them:
 *
 * - **Say it once.** The budget override, the closeness of the top two, and
 *   the conclusion itself each get exactly one sentence on the page. They
 *   used to appear in four places, which reads as a machine looping rather
 *   than a person explaining.
 *
 * - **Reason, don't score.** The reader is told what they asked for and what
 *   this car does about it. The weighted arithmetic that produced the result
 *   is still calculated, still checkable, and stays out of the sentence.
