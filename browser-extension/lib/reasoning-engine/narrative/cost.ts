/**
 * Money, said precisely.
 *
 * Three rules run through this file:
 *
 * - a rental price, an energy estimate and a total are three different
 *   numbers, and the reader is told which one they're looking at;
 * - an estimate is never presented as a certainty;
 * - what we couldn't calculate is named, not rounded to zero.
 *
 * Cost is not one of the user's ranked priorities — in this product the
 * budget is a hard eligibility constraint the user set explicitly. That is
 * why cost reasoning always appears: the user asked for it directly.
