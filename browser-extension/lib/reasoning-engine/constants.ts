/**
 * How much extra influence a picked-out feature carries.
 *
 * Read the numbers like this: every feature in a category's catalogue counts
 * once, because it is relevant equipment. A feature the user picked out
 * counts again for how much they said it should influence the result — once
 * more for the lowest level, twice for the middle, three times for the
 * highest. Hence 2, 3 and 4 against a base of 1.
 *
 * The ratios matter, not the absolute figures. What they have to achieve is
 * narrow: an extremely-important pick should visibly outweigh a merely
 * important one, and the whole catalogue must stay the denominator so that no
 * single feature can push a category to 0 or 100. Anything much steeper (the
 * old system's 5-to-1) starts letting five picks drown out the ten to fifteen
 * other things the category is actually made of.
 *
 * The three labels are adverbs because the question above them is "how much
 * should this influence your decision?" and an adverb is what answers it —
 * "somewhat", "moderately", "highly" finish the reader's own sentence, where
 * "high / medium / low" was a grading scheme they had to decode first. There
 * is deliberately no "essential" and no "required": nothing here gates a car
 * out, so no label may sound like it does.
 *
 * The colour fields live here rather than in the components so that the
 * scale looks the same everywhere it is shown — the picker in the compare
 * drawer, the priority editor in settings, and the chips in the advice.
 *
 * Three distinct hues, not three depths of one. Depth of colour asks the
 * reader to judge how much of a thing they are looking at, which is a
 * comparison they can only make with two swatches side by side; three hues
 * are told apart on sight, one at a time, which is how these are actually
 * read — one row at a glance in a list of fifteen.
 *
 * Emerald and orange are darker than the ones this scale shipped with, and
 * that is a contrast fix rather than a change of mind: white on the old
 * #009966 measured 3.65:1 and on #f54900 3.60:1, against the 4.5:1 that the
 * 10px labels they carry need. See assets/tailwind.css for the full set.
