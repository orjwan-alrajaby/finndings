/**
 * One car, judged against one reader — the question asked on finn.com while
 * they are looking at a car, rather than the question the Compare page asks.
 *
 * The two are different questions and this file is careful about which one it
 * is answering. Compare asks "which of these fits me best?", and its answer is
 * relative by construction: boot space, range and CO₂ are scored against the
 * rest of the pinned set. Here there is no set. So:
 *
 * - **What is scored** is the part of the engine that was already absolute —
 *   how much of a priority's equipment catalogue the car carries, with the
 *   features the reader picked out weighted up. `categoryDetail` computes
 *   exactly that and needs no second implementation.
 *
 * - **What is reported but never scored** is every measurement. A relative
 *   score needs a population to be relative to, and inventing one — "cars like
 *   this usually have 450 km" — would be inventing the reader a rival. The
 *   figure is shown as a figure.
 *
 * - **What is never said** is a number out of a hundred. The reader is told
 *   how much of what they asked for this car has, in counts they can check.
 *   The weighted arithmetic underneath decides the ordering and the band, and
 *   stays off the page.
 *
 * Nothing here re-scores anything. It calls the engine with a set of one and
 * arranges the answer.

 * priorities are met" — the meter is a picture of the band, and the band is a

 * meter reading as an arbitrary mark out of four. A reader who set fewer than
 * five priorities still gets five segments, which is fine: the scale is the
 * product's, not their own.
 *
 * The steps are the presentation judgement, and only the ends are forced.
 * `strong` has to fill the meter or the top band looks unfinished, `unknown`
 * has to be empty because it is the one state that is an absence of a claim
 * rather than a weak one, and the middle has to stay monotonic. That leaves
 * one segment more than there are bands to spend it on, and it goes into the
 * gap above `limited`: those are the cars that answer almost nothing the
 * reader asked for, and one lit segment says so more honestly than two.

 * gave it. So the ceiling is only reachable by a car that has essentially all
 * of a fifteen-item catalogue, and the thresholds have to be read against
 * that rather than against a school grade.
 *
 * Worked through: a fifteen-feature catalogue with five picks at the highest
 * influence has a denominator of 30. A car with every one of those picks and
 * nothing else scores 67; with half the remaining catalogue as well, 83. A car
 * with none of the picks but two-thirds of the catalogue scores 33. The
