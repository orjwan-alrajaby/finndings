/**
 * What Lens sends a model, and what it accepts back.
 *
 * Deliberately free of imports: nothing in here may pull the reasoning
 * engine — or anything else that decides — into what the model sees. Ids are plain strings on purpose: on the
 * way back they are *claims* by a language model, and `proposal.ts` is where
 * they are checked against the real vocabulary before anything uses them.
 *
 * The split the whole experiment rests on:
 *
 *   natural language ─► model      ─► ProposedChange ─► validate ─► Answers ─► engine
 *   engine result    ─► LensFacts  ─► model          ─► prose
 *
 * The model never sees a scoring function and never returns a score.
