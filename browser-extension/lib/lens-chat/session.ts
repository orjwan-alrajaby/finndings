 * The search a conversation built, kept where the rest of Lens can find it.

 * Without this the chat on finn.com and the recommendation page are two
 * products: a reader explains their life to one of them and then meets the
 * other still running last month's saved settings. The session is the bridge —
 * the temporary profile, what it was built from, and enough of the
 * conversation to recognise it later.
 *
 * It is never Lens's saved settings. Carrying it over applies it to the page
 * in front of the reader; saving it keeps a copy they can come back to. Both
 * leave their saved priorities and profiles exactly as they were.
