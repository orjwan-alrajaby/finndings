 * vocabulary — the tradeoffs and the feature groups. One scale across all of
 * them, so a green edge means the same thing in each and a reader never has to
 * learn a second colour language halfway down a panel.
 *
 * This was `ENVIRONMENT_TONE`, in `environment-copy`, which was accurate while

 * weight, not colour, so the colour is free to mean one thing.
 *
 * `ink` and `ground` exist for the environmental result's verdict card, where
 * the reading is a phrase rather than a pill — "Moderate emissions", set in
 * the tone's own colour on the tone's own tint. `bar` is the filled part of
 * the comparison bar, which needs the hue solid rather than pale.
 *
 * `deep` is `ink` again wherever `ink` is already dark enough, and darker
 * where it isn't: a 10px caption needs 4.5:1 against what it sits on, and
 * accent blue on pale blue measures 4.11:1 — fine for a mark, short for a
 * label. The method fold's two headings are set in it, on their own tints.
