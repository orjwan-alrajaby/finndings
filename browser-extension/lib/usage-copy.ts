/**
 * How much energy a car uses, decided once for every surface that says it.
 *
 * Three surfaces ask this question — the in-page panel, the pinned car's
 * analysis card, and the advice page — and they lay it out very differently:
 * a 26rem strip inside finn.com, a card in a list, and a full-width section on
 * a page of its own. What they must not differ on is *which* of the three
 * answers a given car gets, or the words it gets them in.
 *
 * The three are genuinely different answers rather than one answer with
 * missing parts:
 *
 * - **graded** — a figure, and a cohort to read it against.
 * - **ungradable** — a plug-in hybrid. One blended figure over an assumed
 *   pattern of charging belongs to no cohort, so grading it would be inventing
 *   a comparison rather than reporting one.
 * - **unpublished** — FINN supplied no consumption at all. Said out loud,
 *   because a section that quietly disappears reads as a section that failed
 *   to load.
 *
 * Sits beside `cost-copy` and `car-labels`, for the same reason: anything that
 * decides what a reader is told belongs outside the thing that draws it.
