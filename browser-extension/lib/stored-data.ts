/**
 * Everything Finn Lens has put in browser storage, and how to take it back
 * out.
 *
 * The extension could only ever accumulate. Settings could be restored to
 * their defaults, but a pinned car was permanent, the browsing cache grew
 * for as long as the reader used finn.com, and nothing anywhere said what
 * was being kept. For a tool that reads a shopping site and stores what you
 * looked at, "you cannot see it and you cannot delete it" is the wrong
 * answer twice over.
 *
 * So this file is the single list of what is stored, in the reader's terms
 * rather than in storage keys — and clearing works the way clearing browsing
 * data works, by category, with a plain count of what each one holds so the
 * decision is informed rather than brave.
 *
 * Anything added to storage anywhere in the extension belongs in `GROUPS`.
 * A key that isn't here is a key the reader has no way to delete.
